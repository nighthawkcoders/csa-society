## Spring Framework
Spring allows a Java class to be transformed to manage web routes through class methods. Using expanded annotations (more powerful than @Override), entire classes can be categorized. These annotations are key to interact with key properties of the Spring framework. In code, the ``@SpringBootApplication`` annotation is placed above the main class to signal the entry point for the application. Take a look at the aforementioned code in context:
``` Java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Main.class, args);
    }

}
```
Multiple classes can be defined as `@Controller` in which web routes are defined as methods of that class. Defining routes in multiple classes allows for organization as well as more efficient state management. For multiple pages where a logged in user persisted, the user id could be stored as a instance variable of the controller.
``` Java
@Controller
public class WebsiteInformationController {
    private int userId
    /*
        web routes defined here
    */
}
```
Annotations are also used to signal that the defined method is a web route. The return type of these methods are always `String`, as the method will return the HTML page to render or a direct return value such as JSON. GET requests (initial page rendering) and POST requests (page is updated based on user interaction) are represented respectively as `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping`.
``` Java
@GetMapping("/about")
    public String about() {
        return "info/about"; // directory path inside of templates to HTML document
    }
```
The practical use of `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping` can be seen practically when in tandem with ThymeLeaf (Python: Django), the HTML templating of choice for this example. To pass data to ThymeLeaf, the `Model` type must be used (note `Model` is a Spring type, thus it will work with any templating engine). The `Model` is the gateway to pass data or entire Java objects to HTML. An object of `Model` acts as a container for all of the data which is then accessed in the HTML document. The code segment below demostrates how a Java object can be stored in a model object passed as parameter.
``` Java
@GetMapping("/listPeople")
public String listEveryone(Model model) {
    Person rupert = new Person("Rupert", "Kerr");
    Person clive = new Person("Clive", "Buckley");
    
    model.addAttribute("personName", rupert.firstName); // only saves the first name stored in rupert
    model.addAttribute("personObj", clive); // saves entire Java object, where both attributes of the Person class are accessible 
    
    return "person/peopleTable";
}
```
Inside of the HTML document, two values will be accessible that were passed from Java. Each piece of data is now accessible ThymeLeaf object.
1. `personName` which holds a single raw `String` "Rupert"
2. `personObj` which hold a `Person` object with both attributes "Clive" and "Buckley" accessible using the same getter methods as Java

## Key ThymeLeaf Syntax
ThymeLeaf goes hand in hand with Spring data and has some helpful syntax that allows for each loops, switch cases, etc. 
> A ThymeLeaf object is inserted into HTML with `th:text=` inside of any HTML tag that displays text. The ThymeLeaf object itself is read with this syntax `${_objectName_}`.

Combining these two principles, consider the following code segment where the first name of our `Person` objects are displayed:
``` HTML
<body>
    <div class="content">
        <h1>
            <p th:text="${personName}"></p>
            <p th:text="${personObj.getFirstName()}"></p>
        </h1>
    </div>
</body>
```
Notice that since `personName` is a raw String, it can be referred to directly. In contrast, as the naming convention implies, `personObj` cannot be referred to directly. In order to extract data from the instance variables, a getter must be used. In fact, any method of the class being referenced as if it is in Java as long as it is inside of the brackets (for this example only methods that return a value are practical). 
> Can multiple objects be inserted on the same line? Yes, ThymeLeaf follows general concatentation syntax:
``` HTML
<body>
    <div class="content">
        <h1>
            <p th:text="'Person 1: ' + ${personName} + ', Person 2: ' + ${personObj.getFirstName()} + ' ' 
                        + ${personObj.getLastName()}"></p>
        </h1>
    </div>
</body>
```
> Person 1: Rupert, Person 2: Clive Buckley
